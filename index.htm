            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>There is no easy answer to this question due to the many different classifications
                 of computers.<br> The first mechanical computer, created by Charles Babbage in 1822, 
                 doesn't resemble what most would consider a computer today.<br> 
                 Therefore, this page lists each of the computer firsts, 
                 starting with the Difference Engine and leading up to the computers we use today.</p>

                 <h3>First general-purpose computer</h3>
                 <p>In 1837, Charles Babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer, 
                    the Analytical Engine.<br> The Analytical Engine contained an ALU (arithmetic logic unit),
                     basic flow control, punch cards (inspired by the Jacquard Loom), and integrated memory.
                      <br>It is the first general-purpose computer concept that could be used for many things,
                       not only one particular computation.<br> Unfortunately, because of funding issues, 
                       this computer was never built while Charles Babbage was alive.<br> In 1910, Henry Babbage, Charles Babbage's youngest son,
                     completed a portion of this machine and performed basic calculations.</p>
